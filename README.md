## Description

In this challenge I was tasked with creating a tech blog that can post to a home page and see a collection of my posts on the main page. When the user logs in they

will be redirected to a new main page with user loaded content. The user will have to register first on the website using authentication I used from my project 2. 


## Install

The user should run npm i into the command line and it will install the packages needed for this repo in the package.json file. Some of the packages include sequelize,

express, handlebars, and mysql2


## Demo

Soon to be added.
